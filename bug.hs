This Haskell code attempts to use the `undefined` value, which results in a runtime error.  The error is subtle because it might not manifest immediately, depending on how `undefined` is used later in the program. 
```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = undefined :: Int  --The undefined value
  let y = x + 1
  print y
```
