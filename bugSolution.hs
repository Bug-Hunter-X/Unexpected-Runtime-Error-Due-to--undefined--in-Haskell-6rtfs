The solution replaces the undefined value with a default value to handle potential issues.  
```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let x = 0 :: Int -- Default value
  let y = x + 1
  print y
```
This version of the code will compile and execute successfully, printing '1' to the console.  Alternatively, better error handling could be implemented using `Maybe` or `Either` to gracefully handle situations where a value might be missing or invalid.
